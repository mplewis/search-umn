#Purpose
To search the [UMN People Directory](http://search.umn.edu/) using a Python API.

#Example

The basic usage of the script is as follows:
	
	./search.py McKinney

To search for a person using their full name, enclose it in quotation marks like:

	./search.py "Nicholas McKinney"

To search by Internet ID instead of name, use `-t` or `--search_type`:

	./search.py -t id McKinney

To limit your search to a particular campus, use `-c` or `--campus`. The following campus codes are allowed:

	a	Any campus
	c	Crookston
	d	Duluth
	m	Morris
	r	Rochester
	t	Twin Cities
	o	Other
	
	Example:
